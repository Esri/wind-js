This project is an experiment in client-side data processing and visualization. Most of the code in this project is taken from https://github.com/cambecc/earth and has been re-purposed to support easier application to a variety of mapping APIs and Frameworks. 

## How it works 

The code for this project uses nothing but an HTML5 Canvas element and pure Javascript. The data come from the Global Forecast System which produces a large variety of datasets as continuous global gridded datasets (more info below). The data is passed into a JS class called `Windy` which takes the bounds of the map, the data, and the canvas element and then applies a [Bilinear Interpolation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilinear_interpolation) to generate a smooth surface. Once the surface has been generated a function randomly places "particles" onto canvas at random x/y points. Each particle is then "evolved", moving in a direction and at a velocity that is dictated by the interpolated surface.

## The Data 

For more information about GFS data visit: [GFS Data](http://nomads.ncdc.noaa.gov/data.php?name=access#hires_weather_datasets).

Before GFS data can be used with this code it has to be converted into JSON. To do this we used another awesome project by @cambecc here [https://github.com/cambecc/grib2json](https://github.com/cambecc/grib2json). That tool converts data in the GRIB2 file format into a JSON structure with the grid represented as an array. An example result of that tool can be seen in the `gfs.json` file.
